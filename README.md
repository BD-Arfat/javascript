## 📘 JavaScript Learning Journey

I have been learning **JavaScript** from the [Programming Hero CEO's book](https://web.programming-hero.com/home/ph-book).  
My approach has been:
- ✅ First, I did **hands-on practice**.
- 🧠 Then, I focused on **problem solving** to strengthen my understanding.

If you're interested in learning JavaScript, I highly recommend this book!
